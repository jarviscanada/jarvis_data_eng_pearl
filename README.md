# Pearl Guo . Jarvis Consulting

Hi there! I am a recent graduate of the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my school time, I developed a thorough understanding of data structure and algorithms. I enjoy being challenged and engaged with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new development techniques and skills are important to me. I am an independent worker with limited supervision needed and meanwhile a collaborative team player. While I am free, I like to go hiking and reading.

## Skills


**Proficient:** Java, Bash, SQL, Agile/Scrum, Python, HTML/CSS, OOP, Git, Linux


**Competent:** Docker, SpringBoot, JDBC, Google Cloud, Maven, JUnit

## Development Projects


Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_pearl](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_pearl)

- **[Cluster Monitor](./linux_sql)**: Developed an internal tool to record hardware specifications and track server node usage for the Linux cluster administrator team using bash scripts. Collected the usage data leveraging PostgreSQL and generated reports for further planning purposes.
- **[Core Java Apps](./core_java)**:  Programmed a JavaGrep program that is similar to Grep with Java Stream API. Programmed JDBC by implementing a Data Access Object (DAO) pattern that leverages Data Transfer Object (DTO) to transfer the data between different classes and performs CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on DTOs. Programmed a Java app which can post/show/delete Twitter post via Twitter REST API.
- **[SpringBoot App](./springboot)**: in-progress
- **[Cloud & DevOps](./cloud_devops)**: Not started
- **[Hadoop](./hadoop)**: Not started
- **[Spark/Scala](./spark)**:  Not started

Improved and maintained Broad Street Database utilizing **PostgreSQL.**

**Instructional Support Assistant,  University of Waterloo, Waterloo (2014-2014):** Led tutorials and held office hours, assisted students in understanding course concepts and performed evaluations.

## Education & Academic Projects

**University of Waterloo (2013-2019)**, Bachelor of Computer Science, Computer Science, Bioinformatics option

- **Quadris:** Wrote a game very similar to Tetris in C++ leveraging Observer Pattern, except it is controlled via text commands.

- **Network Simulation program:** Wrote a program in Python that simulates both TCP and UDP socket programming in a client-server environment. Write a protocol that should be able to handle network errors such as packet loss and duplicate packets to send files to the receiver over an unreliable network.
